## 📝 What Was Changed

### Frontend (1 file)
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
  - Improved delete logic to load next conversation instead of always creating new one

### Backend (3 files)
- `storage-service/models.py`
  - Use timezone-aware datetimes (UTC)
- `storage-service/main.py`
  - Custom JSON encoder to add 'Z' suffix to UTC timestamps
  - Update timestamps with timezone info
- `storage-service/schemas.py`
  - Field serializers to ensure 'Z' suffix on datetime fields
  - Better Pydantic serialization

## ✅ Verification

After restarting, verify:

**Delete Works:**
- [ ] Can delete blank conversations
- [ ] Deleting current conversation loads another one (if available)
- [ ] Only creates new conversation if none left

**Timestamps Work:**
- [ ] New messages show "just now"
- [ ] After 2 minutes, shows "2 minutes ago"
- [ ] No more "7 hours ago" for recent messages
- [ ] Page refresh doesn't break timestamps
