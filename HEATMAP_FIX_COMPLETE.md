# Correlation Heatmap Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue

**Problem**: When users asked for a correlation matrix or heatmap, the visualization was not displayed.

**Example Query**: "Show me a correlation matrix" or "Create a correlation heatmap"

**Expected**: A colorful heatmap showing correlations between numerical features

**Actual**: No visualization appeared (empty response or only text)

---

## Root Cause

The issue had **two causes**:

### 1. Missing Seaborn Library ❌
- Correlation heatmaps are typically created with `seaborn.heatmap()`
- Seaborn was **not installed** in the chat-service dependencies
- When AI generated code using `sns.heatmap()`, it would fail with `NameError: name 'sns' is not defined`

### 2. Seaborn Not Available in Execution Environment ❌
- Even if installed, `sns` (seaborn) was not added to the `safe_globals` in the code executor
- Python code couldn't access seaborn during execution

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Add Seaborn to Dependencies

**File**: `chat-service/pyproject.toml`

Added seaborn to the dependencies list:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.115.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.30.0",
    "openai>=1.3.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.1",
    "pydantic>=2.5.0",
    "httpx>=0.25.1",
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.24.0",
    "matplotlib>=3.7.0",
    "seaborn>=0.12.0",  # ← NEW!
]
```

### Step 2: Import Seaborn in Code Executor

**File**: `chat-service/code_executor.py`

Added seaborn import at the top:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Non-interactive backend
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns  # ← NEW!
```

### Step 3: Make Seaborn Available in Execution Environment

**File**: `chat-service/code_executor.py`

Added `sns` to safe_globals:
```python
# Prepare safe globals
safe_globals = {
    'pd': pd,
    'np': np,
    'plt': plt,
    'sns': sns,  # ← NEW!
    'print': print,
    '__builtins__': __builtins__,
}
```

### Step 4: Update System Prompt

**File**: `chat-service/data_analysis_agent.py`

1. **Updated capabilities section:**
```python
**Your Capabilities:**
- You have access to pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries
- Available imports: pd (pandas), np (numpy), plt (matplotlib.pyplot), sns (seaborn)
```

2. **Added correlation heatmap example:**
```python
Example 4 - Correlation Heatmap:
User: "Show me a correlation matrix"
You: "I'll create a correlation matrix heatmap to visualize the relationships between all numerical features.

```python
# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).corr()

# Create heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0, 
            square=True, linewidths=1, cbar_kws={"shrink": 0.8})
plt.title('Correlation Matrix Heatmap')
plt.tight_layout()
```

The heatmap uses color intensity to show correlation strength..."
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Use the Installation Script
```bash
cd chat-app
./install-seaborn.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

Using UV (recommended):
```bash
cd chat-app/chat-service
uv pip install seaborn>=0.12.0
```

Or using pip:
```bash
cd chat-app/chat-service
pip install seaborn>=0.12.0
```

### Restart Services
After installation, restart the services:
```bash
cd chat-app
./stop-services.sh
./start-services.sh
```

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Correlation Matrix
```
User: "Show me a correlation matrix"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Explanation of what correlation matrix shows
- ✅ Colorful heatmap visualization with:
  - Numerical correlation values (annot=True)
  - Color gradient (coolwarm colormap)
  - Red = positive correlation
  - Blue = negative correlation
  - White = no correlation
- ✅ Interpretation of the results

### Test Case 2: Iris Dataset Correlation
```
User: "Create a correlation heatmap for the iris dataset"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ 4x4 heatmap showing correlations between:
  - sepal_length
  - sepal_width
  - petal_length
  - petal_width
- ✅ Annotations showing exact correlation values
- ✅ Insights about which features are most correlated

### Test Case 3: Other Seaborn Visualizations
```
User: "Create a pairplot of the numerical features"
User: "Show me a boxplot by species"
User: "Create a violin plot"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Various seaborn visualizations work correctly
- ✅ All plots are captured and displayed

---

## Before & After

### BEFORE (Not Working ❌)

```
User: "Show me a correlation matrix"
```
Assistant: "I'll create a correlation matrix heatmap..."

[Code executes in background]

ERROR: NameError: name 'sns' is not defined

[User sees: Error message or no output]
```

### AFTER (Working ✅)

```
User: "Show me a correlation matrix"
```
Assistant: "I'll create a correlation matrix heatmap to visualize the relationships between all numerical features. This will help identify which variables are strongly correlated (positive or negative) and which are independent."

[Code executes in background - HIDDEN]

[Beautiful heatmap appears with:]
- 4x4 grid for iris dataset
- Colorful gradient (red/blue)
- Correlation values shown (0.82, -0.42, etc.)
- Clear labels for all features

"The heatmap uses color intensity to show correlation strength: red indicates positive correlation, blue indicates negative correlation, and white indicates no correlation.

Looking at your correlation matrix, I can see that petal_length and petal_width are highly correlated (0.96), suggesting these measurements tend to increase together. Meanwhile, sepal_width shows weak or negative correlations with other features, indicating it varies more independently."
```

## Available Seaborn Functions

Now that seaborn is installed and available, users can request:

### Statistical Visualizations

## Technical Details

### Code Execution Flow

1. **User requests correlation heatmap**
   ↓
2. **AI generates code**:
   ```python
   corr_matrix = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).corr()
   sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
   ```
   ↓
3. **Code executor prepares environment**:
   - Imports: pd, np, plt, **sns** ✅
   - Makes dataframes available
   - Sets up matplotlib backend
   ↓
4. **Code executes**:
   - Calculates correlation matrix with pandas
   - Creates heatmap with seaborn
   - Matplotlib captures the figure
   ↓
5. **Plot captured as base64**:
   - Figure saved to BytesIO buffer
   - Converted to base64 string
   - Sent to frontend
   ↓
6. **Frontend displays**:
   - Renders as `<img src="data:image/png;base64,..."/>`
   - Shows in chat message

### Why Seaborn?

Seaborn is essential for data analysis because:
- **Built on matplotlib** - Compatible with existing plot capture logic
- **Statistical visualizations** - Designed for data analysis tasks
- **Beautiful defaults** - Professional-looking plots out of the box
- **Common in data science** - Users expect it to be available
- **Correlation heatmaps** - The standard tool for this visualization

**Changes**:
- Import: `import seaborn as sns`
- Globals: Added `'sns': sns` to safe_globals
- Makes seaborn available during code execution

### 3. `chat-service/data_analysis_agent.py`
**Changes**:
- Updated capabilities to mention seaborn
- Added correlation heatmap example
- Teaches AI how to use seaborn correctly

### 4. `install-seaborn.sh` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Convenient installation script

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not showing heatmap
**Solution**: Make sure seaborn is installed and services are restarted
```bash
cd chat-app/chat-service
uv pip install seaborn
cd ..
./stop-services.sh
./start-services.sh
```

### Issue: Import error in logs
**Solution**: Check if seaborn is in the virtual environment
```bash
cd chat-app/chat-service
uv pip list | grep seaborn
```

### Issue: Plot appears but without colors
**Solution**: The code might not be using seaborn. Check if AI is using `plt.imshow()` instead of `sns.heatmap()`
