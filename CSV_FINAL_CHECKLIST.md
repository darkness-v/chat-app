## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start Services
```bash
cd /Users/tani/TechJDI/chat-app
./stop-services.sh  # Stop any running services
./start-services.sh # Start all services
```

### 2. Verify Services Running
- Storage Service: http://localhost:8002/health (should return {"status": "healthy"})
- Chat Service: http://localhost:8001/health (should return {"status": "healthy"})
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (should show chat UI)

### 3. Test CSV Upload
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. You should see "📊 CSV Data Analysis" section
3. Try uploading a test CSV or use URL: 
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv
   ```

### 4. Test Data Analysis
Ask these questions:
- "Summarize the dataset"
- "Show basic statistics"
- "Plot a histogram of sepal_length"

Expected behavior:
- ✅ AI generates Python code
- ✅ Code executes automatically
- ✅ Output displayed inline
- ✅ Plots embedded in chat

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Port already in use
**Error:** `Port 8001/8002/3000 is already in use`

**Solution:**
```bash
./stop-services.sh
# Wait 5 seconds
./start-services.sh
```

### Issue 2: Dependencies not found
**Error:** `Import "pandas" could not be resolved`

**Solution:**
```bash
cd chat-service
uv pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Issue 3: OpenAI API errors
**Error:** `OpenAI API key not configured`

**Solution:**
```bash
nano chat-service/.env
# Add: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Issue 4: CSV upload fails
**Error:** `Failed to upload CSV`

**Solution:**
- Check file is valid CSV format
- Verify storage-service is running on port 8002
- Check `storage-service/uploads/` directory exists and is writable

### Issue 5: Code execution errors
**Error:** Code fails to execute

**Solution:**
- Check chat-service logs: `tail -f logs/chat-service.log`
- Verify CSV loaded: Check for "Successfully loaded CSV" message
- Try simpler code first: "print(df.shape)"

### Issue 6: Frontend build errors
**Error:** TypeScript compilation errors

**Solution:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Backend Services
```bash
# Storage Service health
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# Chat Service health  
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Upload test CSV
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/upload-csv \
  -F "file=@test.csv"
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# View all logs
tail -f logs/*.log

# Just chat service
tail -f logs/chat-service.log

# Just storage service
tail -f logs/storage-service.log
```

### Check Processes
```bash
# See running services
ps aux | grep -E "(uvicorn|npm)"

# See ports in use
lsof -i :8001
lsof -i :8002
lsof -i :3000
```

## Performance Expectations

### Normal Operation
- CSV load time: < 1 second (for 10MB files)
- Code generation: 2-5 seconds
- Code execution: < 1 second (simple operations)
- Total response: 3-7 seconds end-to-end

### Resource Usage
- Memory per conversation: ~50-100MB (with DataFrame)
- CPU: Moderate during code execution
- Disk: Minimal (uploads stored in `uploads/`)

## Security Reminders

⚠️ **Current implementation is for development only**

For production:
- [ ] Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, timeout)
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization
- [ ] Use containerized code execution (Docker)
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all inputs
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all endpoints
- [ ] Restrict library imports
- [ ] Add user quotas

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:
- ✅ CSV files upload successfully
- ✅ AI generates relevant Python code
- ✅ Code executes without crashes
- ✅ Results display inline with formatting
- ✅ Plots render as images
- ✅ Error retry works automatically
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations work
- ✅ No memory leaks over time

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✅ Run `./start-services.sh`
2. ✅ Open http://localhost:3000
3. ✅ Upload test CSV
4. ✅ Ask first question
5. ✅ Verify results appear

### Short Term (This Week)
- [ ] Test with various CSV files
- [ ] Try complex queries
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Collect user feedback

### Medium Term (This Month)
- [ ] Add more visualization types (Seaborn, Plotly)
- [ ] Support multiple DataFrames
- [ ] Export results feature
- [ ] Code history/templates
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Long Term (Future)
- [ ] Production security hardening
- [ ] Advanced ML integration
- [ ] Collaborative analysis
- [ ] Real-time data streaming
- [ ] Jupyter-style notebooks
