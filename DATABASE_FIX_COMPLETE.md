# ✅ Database Migration - Issue Fixed!

## Problem
When starting the services, you encountered:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: messages.image_url
```

## Root Cause
Your database (`chat_history.db`) was created **before** the image feature was added, so it didn't have the `image_url` column in the `messages` table.

## Solution Applied ✅

1. **Updated migration script** to use correct database name (`chat_history.db`)
2. **Ran migration** to add `image_url` column to existing database
3. **Created fix script** (`./fix-database.sh`) for future issues
4. **Updated documentation** with troubleshooting steps

## What Was Done

```bash
# Migration executed successfully
cd storage-service
uv run python migrate_db.py
# Output: Adding image_url column to messages table...
#         Migration completed successfully!

# Verified column was added
sqlite3 chat_history.db "PRAGMA table_info(messages);"
# Shows: 5|image_url|VARCHAR(500)|0||0
```

## Your Database Is Now Ready! 🎉

You can restart your services and everything will work:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Storage Service
cd storage-service
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002

# Terminal 2 - Chat Service
cd chat-service
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## If You Encounter This Again

**Option 1: Use the fix script (Recommended)**
```bash
./fix-database.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual migration**
```bash
cd storage-service
uv run python migrate_db.py
```

**Option 3: Fresh start (Deletes all data!)**
```bash
cd storage-service
rm chat_history.db
# Restart service - new DB will have correct schema
```

## What Changed in the Database

**Before:**
```sql
messages
├── id
├── conversation_id
├── role
├── content
└── timestamp
```

**After:**
```sql
messages
├── id
├── conversation_id
├── role
├── content
├── image_url        ← NEW!
└── timestamp
```

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `storage-service/migrate_db.py` - Fixed to use `chat_history.db`
2. ✅ `setup-uv.sh` - Now checks for both database names
3. ✅ `fix-database.sh` - NEW! Quick fix script for this issue
4. ✅ `IMAGE_CHAT_GUIDE.md` - Added troubleshooting section
5. ✅ `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Added database fix command

## Testing Image Chat

Once your services are running:

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click the 📷 image icon
3. Select a PNG or JPG image
4. Type a message (or leave blank)
5. Click Send
6. AI will analyze the image! ✨

## Prevention

The `setup-uv.sh` script now automatically runs the migration during setup, so new users won't encounter this issue.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

Your database has been successfully migrated and is ready for image chat!

Happy chatting with images! 🎉🖼️
